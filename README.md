## Description

Healthvider streamlines the process of booking medical appointments by providing a user-friendly platform where patients can view doctor profiles, check availability, and book appointments. The application also includes an admin interface for managing doctor approvals and an interface for doctors to update their profiles.

## Tech Stack

Healthvider is built using the MERN stack:

- **MongoDB**: For the database to store all data related to users, doctors, appointments, and schedules.
- **Express**: For the backend server to handle API requests and manage the application logic.
- **React**: For the frontend to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Node.js**: For the backend runtime environment to execute JavaScript code server-side.
